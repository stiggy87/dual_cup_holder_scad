Dual Cup Holder using OpenSCAD and BOSL2

This is designed for the iRocker Nautica SUP (Stand-up Paddle Board). This is based on the iRocker cupholder (https://irockersup.com/products/paddle-board-cup-holder-standard).

It has the following features:
* M8 Screw hole with hex head for a near flush addition -- Allows for it to be used to screw in
* An optional TPU washer to replace the one the board comes with
* 90mm height (80mm internal)
* 84mm wide holders (this was mostly for supporting Contigo containers)

This an open design and PRs will be honored if desired, or remixed.

# Remixing
I tried to be as programmatic as possible for this, and provide variables at the top to allow for adjustments to fit your needs; however, there are hardcoded lines that I would like to update. If you have a desire to fix this and make the scad file better and more dynamic, I'm all for it, just file a PR.

## Why use OpenSCAD vs Other CADs?
I tried using other CAD programs (FreeCAD/Ondsel, TinkerCAD) to design, but with how different each one is, and how difficult it was for me to try and learn it, OpenSCAD looked to be the easiest solution. I tried to learn FreeCAD/Ondsel for this, but I was getting very frustrated on the workflow and lack of user functionality, and I'm a better programmer anyways.

Besides, FreeCAD supports OpenSCAD, so you can take the scad file and import it to FreeCAD to generate the part and make modifications.
